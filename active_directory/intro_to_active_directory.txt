ADDS - Active Directory Directory Services provides a centralized IT Auth framework. 
Active directory has a top domain for examole invoca.com. The highest level domain is called a forest and it contains all the services. AD oftentimes also has subdomains..

Elements of Active Directory 
- DC (Domain Controller) - Stores all relevant information for the forest provides all the auth services.Contains core services. 

The forest contains multiple Domain Controllers so that there is a redundancy of data and services, and replicate Active Directory data. 

Active Directory also contains windows servers and windows clients. These are called domain-joined. The domain controllers contain services to provide auth to computers and services running on them . Sometimes linux computers are part of the domain, however it is not implemented like that usually.

Kerberos is the network protocol used for auth in AD.Kereros was created by MIT and is used as Microsofts primary authentication mechanisn since 2003. 

This is how the Authentication and Authorization process works. 

When Esty Scheiner logs in to her computer, the computer sends an Authentication Server Request (AS_REQ) with a timestamp that is encrypted using a hash derived from her username and password to the KDC (Kuberos Domain Controller)

Then the KDC recieves the request and looks up the password hash associatd with the user and then tries to decrypt the timestamp, if the decryption process is successful and the timestamp is not a dup[licate then the auth is considered successsful.

After successful validation the KDC responds with an Auth Server Reply (AS_REP) with a session key and a ticket granting ticket. The session key is encrypted with the users password hash, and can be decrypted by user and reused. 

The TGT contains info regarding the user the domain the timestamp the IP address of client and the session key. The TGT is encrypted with a special key only known by the KDC. It cannot be decrypted by the client. When client recieves TGT and Session Key, auth is considered complete. TGT is vaid for 10 hours, and then renewal. 

When client wants to access a resource, it sends a Ticket Granting Service request packet (TGS_REQ) with the name of the user and a timestamp, the name of the resource, and encrypted TGT to KDC. 

Then the ticket granting service of the KDC recieves the TGS_REQ. If the resource exists, the TGT is decrypted with the secret key only known to the KDC,. Session key is extracted and used to decrypt username and timestamp of the request. Then the KDC does a few checks to make sure TGT has a valid timestamp. That the username from the TGS_REQ matches the username from the TGT, and that the client IP address concides with the TGT IP address. It's basically making sure that someone isn't trying to pass in another TGT 

If all goes well, the TGS respinds with a Ticket Granting Service Reply(TGS_REP) containing the name of the service being granted, a session key for the clinet to use for the service and a service ticket with the username and group memeberships with a new session key. 

Once auth process is complete the client has a session key and a service ticket, then the service authentication begins. 

first. Client sends an application request with the username and a timestamp encrypted with tthe session key associated with the service along with the service ticket itself. 

the application server decrypts the service ticket and extracts the username and session key, it makes sure that everything else is on order. for example, it uses the session key to decrypt the username from the AP_REQ, if it matches, it checks the group membershps and assigns appropiate permissions. The request is accepted, and the client can now access the service. This whole process is to mitigate various network attacks. etc. 

Kerberos handles authentication and authorization. LDAP Lightweight Directory Access Protocol is used to interact with domain controllers to submit or retrieve data.
