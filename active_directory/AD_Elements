AD uses objects to store any data including users and computers. It assigns a SID or a Security Identifier which has the structure of 'S-R-I-S'
S- Identifies the string as a SID
R- revision level (1 usually)
I- identifier -authority value  
S  - Sub-authority value
S-1-5-21-2536614405-3629634762-1218571035-1116

All data is stored at the forest level or inside the Organizational Unit (OU). Which is kind of like a directory and files and folders on a file system

Active Directory uses group membership's to give access. 
There are two main groups:
Distribution groups and Security groups. Distribution groups - define email lists
Security groups - access rights and permission abilities 

Sometimes there are group memberships inside of group membership is known as nested groups. The advantage of it is flexibility, disadvantage is no visibility. In order to see which user accounts are members of given groups you can use the recursive flag 

Get-ADGroupMember ThirdGroup -recursive
